# hey, I’m Tanya 👋

Third-year BBA student majoring in Business, deep into the world of data and decision-making.  
More dashboards, less guesswork.

Currently building a toolkit that includes Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python — to not just look at numbers, but actually **understand** what they say.
